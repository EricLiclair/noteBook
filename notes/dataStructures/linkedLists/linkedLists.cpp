Linked lists are linear data structures in which the data is not stored in contiguos memory locations but every data node
stores the pointer to the next memory address where the data is stored, thereby creating a link.

Representation of linked list:
head -> 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 4 -> 6 -> 4 -> 7 -> 9 -> .... -> 18 -> 10 -> null

Types of linked list data structures:
1. Singly Linked List
2. Doubly Linked List
3. Circular Linked List
